# why k=31?

it's in the goldilocks zone:

- it fits 64 bit w/o overflow (62 bits)
- odd: avoids reverse complement match
- good trade-off between sensitivity and specificity for multicellular organisms.


# discrepancies

small discrepancies with total kmer count in ntCard: I was missing to skip k-mers including N (ntcard and kmc3 do).
